Exercise: Stack
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement the stack (first-in, last-out) operations declared in the 
stack.h header file.

Use main.c to test your implementation.

$ ./stack 
stack size = 4
4
3
2
1

Use valgrind to proof that your implementation does a proper
memory management.
