Weld is the reference implementation of CDI: Contexts and Dependency Injection for 
the Java EE Platform which is the Java standard for dependency injection and 
contextual lifecycle management and one of the most important and popular parts of 
the Java EE platform.

Weld is integrated into many Java EE application servers such as WildFly, JBoss 
Enterprise Application Platform, GlassFish, Oracle WebLogic and others. 
Weld can also be used in a Servlet-only environment (Tomcat, Jetty) or plain Java 
SE environment.
